# RailsLite

- Lite version of Ruby on Rails built as an AppAcademy project.
- Utilized ActiveRecordLite, an ORM created as another
  project. (/lib/active_record_base.rb)
- There are many iterations or versions of the basic server, each with a bit of
  functionality added to it.
- A condensed version, with a basic application built on top can be found at:
  https://github.com/strood/RailsLiteCreations

## Learning Goals

- Know how the basics of the HTTP request-response cycle
- Know how a server works at a fundamental level.
- Be able to explain and implement the functionality of the ControllerBase class
- Know how cookies are used by browsers and servers
- Be able to write a router that parses a URL and instantiates the appropriate controller
- Know how params get built out of the HTTP request's information

## Interaction

- Download, then run a server with:
> $ ruby bin/*server.rb*

- This will start a server at **localhost:3000**

- Each server is doing something different, see notes in server comments to access
  various functionality.
